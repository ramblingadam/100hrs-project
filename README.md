# My 100 Hours Project 
### A Full-Stack web application built with React-Redux, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, and Node.js.

The Minimum Viable Product is functional- users can create accounts, log in, and perform the basic functions of the app with live updates from the database. It also looks pretty nice so far, for an MVP.

However, I cannot release the code or a demo at this time due to future plans for the app. Stay tuned.
